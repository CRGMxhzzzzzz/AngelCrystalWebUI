### Introduction

This web project only provides the initial code, which includes a 'function library' for possible functionality expansion.

This initial code is not perfect, and I hope for more understanding in the future, for details please see the project's wiki.

You can also clone this repository to create your own version and publish it!!!

### Installation tutorial

You'll need a browser and then get the build code.

The constructed code can be obtained from a café, or it can be accessed in the main file (example)

    Gutsy：https://github.com/TimonDessauQwQ/FireTide/tree/main/html%2FGutsy
    Xero：https://github.com/TimonDessauQwQ/FireTide/tree/main/html%2FXero
    Built natively：https://github.com/TimonDessauQwQ/FireTide/tree/main/html%2FoWeb

Alternatively, you can get the HTML file directly from the Release.
